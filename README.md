# VisNeuro
Implementation of visual cortex neurons' behaviors from book `Theoretical Neuroscience by Dayan & Abbott`.


## PART I: LIAF Neuron Model
Implementation of Leaky Integrate-And-Fire Neuron Model.

## PART II: Complex Cell STA Analysis
Implementation of reconstruction of a complex cell's receptive fields using reverse correlation with white noise images.

## PART III: Decoding
Implementation of neuron decoding (perceptron binary classifier) with 100 neurons with different prefered orientations. Calculation of decision variable for two input orientations from population code. 

## PART IV: Decision Making
Implementation of decision making with the decision functions from the PART III using accumulated evidence model.

## PART V: Probablistic Inference
Application and analysis of exact and approximated inference using Gibbs sampling on a simple graphical model.
